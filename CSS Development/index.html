		<p15 class="textfloatright"><img src="impala.jpg" class="imagefloatleft">The Chevrolet Impala is a full-size car built by Chevrolet for model years 1958 to 1985, 1994 to 1996, and since 2000 onwards.

									Production on the model has been planned to end on June 1, 2019.[4]

									The Impala is Chevrolet's popular flagship passenger car and is generally among the better selling automobiles in the United States.[5][6]

									For its debut in 1958, the Impala was distinguished from other models by its symmetrical triple taillights. The Caprice was introduced as a top-line Impala Sport Sedan for model year 1965, later becoming a separate series positioned above the Impala in 1966, which, in turn, remained above the Bel Air and the Biscayne. The Impala continued as Chevrolet's most popular full-size model through the mid-1980s. Between 1994–96, the Impala was revised as a 5.7-liter V8–powered version of the Caprice Classic sedan.

									In 2000, the Impala was reintroduced again as a mainstream front-wheel drive Hi-Mid sedan.[7] As of February 2014, the 2014 Impala ranked #1 among Affordable Large Cars in U.S. News & World Report's rankings.[8] When the tenth generation of the Impala was introduced for the 2014 model year, the ninth generation was rebadged as the Impala Limited and sold only to fleet customers through 2016. During that time both versions were sold in the United States and Canada. The current-generation Impala is also sold in the Middle East, China, and South Korea.</p15>
